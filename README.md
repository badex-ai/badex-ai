I work across the full stack — from React interfaces to Node.js and Python APIs to Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Most of my recent work has been at the infrastructure layer: writing Terraform that provisions real environments, building CI/CD pipelines that teams can trust, and running EKS clusters with canary deployments and proper observability. CKA certified. Electrical engineering background. Available 08:00–22:00 UTC.

**Flagship Project**

**[KABAN](https://github.com/badex-ai/clouddev)** — Full stack app deployed on AWS EKS with a production-grade DevOps pipeline underneath it.

The application is a Kanban board. What makes it worth looking at is the infrastructure: Terraform provisioning a full VPC, EKS cluster, RDS, Elasticache, and Secrets Manager from code. A GitHub Actions pipeline that builds four Docker images, runs Terraform, deploys via Helm, runs zero-downtime Alembic migrations, and verifies the deployment — all triggered by a single push. Canary deployments with configurable 40/60 traffic splitting between stable and canary frontend builds. Per-service CloudWatch log groups for the backend, Celery workers, and both frontend variants.
